2. Why the test failed at first?
	* The correct value wasn't there
3. Why you corrected the test that way?
4. Do you have further questions on this knowledge point?
	* In what cases would you need to return a value in the finally block.
	* Since we have debuggers, what's a different application of accessing method names?
